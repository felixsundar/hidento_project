        <p align="justify"> People often have crush on someone in their social circle. And they are often reluctant to express it, since it
            may be an embarrassment if the other person doesn't feel the same way or it may affect their existing
            friendship. Hidento aims to solve this problem by acting as a common middleman where people can register
            their crushes without any fear of embarrassment or losing their friendship. Hidento is a stable matching
            tool, which matches two users, if they have crush on each other, based on Instagram usernames. It creates
            best possible match for each user with exactly one other user, therefore avoiding conflicts. Hidento is the
            effort of a Bangalore based software engineer.</p><br><br>
